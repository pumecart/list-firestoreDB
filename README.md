# Overview

This project gives me the opportunity to learn about Cloud Databases, specifically Firebase.  I wanted to create a project and have that information stored in the Firebase database. 

This is a simple to-do list project using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Firebase.

Here is a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.

List of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.
